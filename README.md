## Contributing

Once you have setup KhalamAcademy/site:

Run ``python manage.py data add`` to create a new chapter in a subject or to create a new subject itself or a new grade in a existing subject.

Run ``python manage.py data build`` to 'build' all the YAML files into the *.min.json files that the site or any future app will use.

keystone.min.json will contain html in different languages
