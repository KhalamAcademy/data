  We want to provide high quality hollistic education for all people. YouTube and other sources already have tons of content but no good organisation.
  Also. different teachers have different strengths and weaknesses and different styles of teaching. We wanted to combine all of these resources and provide
  a well-rounded and personalised curriculum (note that personalisation is only available when logged in and when our servers are up). We believe in free education
  for all students.
